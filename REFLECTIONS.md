### What went well

I tried first to test each step of the feature at the backend before trying anything at the frontend. At the backend it is easier because there is no redux, and that took me a lot of hours to figure it out the error(s). First things first: try the simpler thing from a feature and console.log to see if is doing what you want or what is supposed to do. Keep track and go further, never tried to implement the whole feature at once. Even so took me time (hours) to realize simple mistakes and misconceptions (lack of experience in web development).

### What would I do differently next time to improve

From now on I will make a reference file with notes with the basic things like the sequelize commands for model and relations and proper adjustments. I will also study more about the data type that is requested because most of the time I had a proper and working request but it was sending the data in the wrong format from the backend. I got a lot of non-friendly errors about the data because I was handling in the wrong way. A few examples: i was sending the data without being in JSON, or sending the whole response instead of just the meaninfull data. And half of the times the app was working and I just could not find the mistake. It is funny how all those doubts came up in the last 3 days. 

### Final thoughts

I'm proud of what I have done so far in this course. Such massive amount of information to process and understand in a short amount of time. The market dictates the pace and we need to play according the rules. I wish I knew at least some basic css to give a better look to this project but that is a next step. First I am gonna focus on get things done.
